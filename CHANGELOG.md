- Publishing workflow automation via `bx dry` command
- Publishing guide for maintainers in README
- Comprehensive installation instructions with crates.io as primary method

  usage
- CLI output now shows `supi` instead of `supi-cli` in version and help
- Edition changed from 2024 to 2021 for broader Rust version compatibility
  (1.56+)
- Test version assertions now dynamically read from `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`
- Updated all test files to reference `supi` binary name

### Fixed

  - `--stop-on-child-exit`
  - `--restart-signal`
  - `--restart-hotkey`
  - `--restart-debounce-ms`
  - `--log-color`
  - `--info-color`
  - `--silent`
- Added publishing information section for maintainers

- Ready for `cargo install --locked supi-cli`

[1.0.0]: https://github.com/bjesuiter/supi-cli/releases/tag/v1.0.0

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-24

### Added

- Colored logging for supervisor messages via `--log-color` flag (default:
  yellow)
- Separate color control for informational messages via `--info-color` flag
  (default: green)
- Support for multiple color options: yellow, red, green, blue, cyan, magenta,
  white, none
- `--silent` flag to suppress all supervisor output while preserving child
  process output
- Restart debouncing via `--restart-debounce-ms` option (default: 1000ms, set to
  0 to disable)
- Configuration display in info messages showing configured hotkey and restart
  signal
- "Child process running (PID: xxx)" log message after spawn for better
  visibility

### Changed

- Refactored output system from function-based to stateful `Output` struct
- Output struct now encapsulates `log_color`, `info_color`, and `silent` flag
- Clear separation between supervisor logs (suppressible) and child output
  (always visible)
- Improved informational messages to show actual configured values

### Technical

- Replaced macro-based output with `Output` struct methods throughout codebase
- Output struct is clonable and can be passed to spawned tasks
- Debouncing applies to both hotkey and signal restart triggers
- Added 12 new tests for Phase 5 features (34 tests total, up from 22)

### Features Summary

âœ… Colored and customizable supervisor output\
âœ… Silent mode for minimal output\
âœ… Restart debouncing to prevent rapid restarts\
