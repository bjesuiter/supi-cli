# Implementation Progress

## 2025-10-24: Session 1 (Part 2)

### Status

**Phase 2 (Basic Process Spawning): ✅ DONE**

- ProcessManager spawns child with tokio::process::Command
- Stdout/stderr forwarding working line-by-line with BufReader
- Process cleanup with kill_on_drop
- Added wait(), restart(), shutdown(), is_running() methods
- Supervisor runs process and waits for exit
- --stop-on-child-exit flag working

**Next: Phase 3 (Signal Handling)**

### What's Implemented

```
✅ src/cli.rs        - Complete CLI parsing
✅ src/main.rs       - Entry point wiring
✅ src/process.rs    - spawn/wait/restart/shutdown with output forwarding
✅ src/supervisor.rs - basic run loop (spawn + wait)
⏸️  src/signals.rs   - STUB
⏸️  src/hotkey.rs    - STUB
```

### Next Action

Implement signal handlers in `src/signals.rs`:

1. Add SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGQUIT handlers using signal-hook-tokio
2. Forward termination signals to child process
3. Implement graceful shutdown with timeout
4. Add SIGUSR1 (or custom) restart signal handler

Update `src/supervisor.rs` to use tokio::select! for event loop.

**Test with:** `bx dev-sleep` then Ctrl+C

### Status

**Phase 1 (CLI & Skeleton): ✅ DONE**

- All modules created with stubs
- CLI fully functional (clap with all args)
- All dependencies added to Cargo.toml
- Compiles successfully
- All functions stubbed with `anyhow::bail!("not implemented yet")`
